From my experience, I realize that I still struggle a lot when it comes to understanding other people’s code. Sometimes I look at a piece of code or even a flowchart and feel lost because I can’t immediately grasp the logic or the flow of the program. It takes me a while to connect the dots, and this has shown me that I need more practice in analyzing and breaking down someone else’s work. However, I really want to improve in this area, since being able to read and understand code efficiently is an important skill as a programmer and a developer.

At the same time, this experience made me aware of how much I still lack in understanding Dart specifically. I was honestly surprised that my friend was able to understand what I was trying to do, even when I wasn’t sure of my own code. Despite that, I’ve found Dart pretty easy to understand compared to other languages. The syntax feels somewhat familiar, especially because it resembles Python in some ways. It doesn’t feel as complicated or overwhelming as Java, which makes me more motivated to keep learning. But overall i think i still have opportunity to grow
